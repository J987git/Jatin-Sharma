**Sales Database Analysis Project**
Overview
This project involves performing SQL-based analysis on a sales database. The analysis covers various aspects of the sales data, such as total sales per order, total sales by city, top customers by total spending, and the top-selling categories. The project utilizes the following SQL operations:

Database Creation

Data Aggregation

Joins between tables

Grouping and Summarizing Data

Database Schema
The project works with three main tables:

listoforders_clean: Contains order details such as Order ID, CustomerName, City, etc.

orderdetails_clean: Contains details for each order such as Order ID, Amount, Quantity, Category, etc.

salestarget_clean: Includes sales target data (though not used in the current queries).

SQL Queries in the Project
1. Creating the Database
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE database salesdb;
USE salesdb;
2. Retrieving Data from Tables
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM listoforders_clean;
SELECT * FROM orderdetails_clean;
SELECT * FROM salestarget_clean;
3. Total Sales per Order
This query calculates the total value of each order.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    od.`Order ID`,
    SUM(od.Amount) AS TotalOrderValue
FROM orderdetails_clean od
GROUP BY od.`Order ID`;
4. Total Sales per City
This query calculates the total sales for each city by joining the listoforders_clean and orderdetails_clean tables.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    lo.City,
    SUM(od.Amount) AS TotalSales
FROM listoforders_clean lo
JOIN orderdetails_clean od ON lo.`Order ID` = od.`Order ID`
GROUP BY lo.City;
5. Top 5 Customers by Total Spending
This query finds the top 5 customers who have spent the most, based on their order totals.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    lo.CustomerName,
    SUM(od.Amount) AS TotalSpent
FROM listoforders_clean lo
JOIN orderdetails_clean od ON lo.`Order ID` = od.`Order ID`
GROUP BY lo.CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC
LIMIT 5;
6. Top Category by Sales
This query calculates the total sales per product category and ranks them in descending order.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    od.Category,
    SUM(od.Quantity) AS ProductSales
FROM orderdetails_clean od
GROUP BY od.Category
ORDER BY ProductSales DESC
LIMIT 5;
7. Total Profit by Category
This query calculates the total profit per product category.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit,
    Category
FROM orderdetails_clean
GROUP BY Category;
Project Setup
1. Database Setup
Run the following command to create the database:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE database salesdb;
Then, use the following command to select the database:

sql
Copy
Edit
USE salesdb;
2. Running Queries
Execute the provided SQL queries sequentially to analyze the data. The queries are designed to be run in a typical SQL environment such as MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio, or any compatible platform.

3. Data Analysis
Each query serves a specific purpose to help analyze different aspects of sales, from total sales by order and city to identifying top customers and categories.

Notes
Data Quality: The tables listoforders_clean, orderdetails_clean, and salestarget_clean are assumed to have cleaned and structured data. If any data cleaning or preprocessing is needed, ensure the datasets are ready for analysis.

Future Enhancements: More queries can be added to analyze other aspects such as sales trends over time, profit margins, etc.
