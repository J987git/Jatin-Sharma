# **Telecom Customer Churn Analysis**

##  Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom company. Churn refers to customers who leave the company's services. By examining historical customer data, we aim to uncover patterns, key factors driving churn, and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

##  Project Structure

- `churn_data.csv` - The dataset containing customer records.
- `telecom_churn_analysis.ipynb` - The Jupyter notebook containing the full EDA and modeling.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

##  Objectives

- Identify the percentage of customers who have churned.
- Analyze the influence of demographic and service-related features on churn.
- Visualize trends and insights.
- Build a predictive model (optional) to classify churn.

##  Key Analysis Performed

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Distribution of churned vs. retained customers
   - Churn rate by contract type, internet service, tenure, and payment method
   - Correlation heatmaps

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Converting categorical variables
   - Removing unnecessary columns

3. **Visualization Tools Used:**
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn
   - Plotly (optional)

4. **Modeling (if applied):**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree / Random Forest
   - Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix

## ** Sample Code Snippet**
```python
# Example: Checking churn distribution
import seaborn as sns
sns.countplot(x='Churn', data=df)
```

## ** Insights**

- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.
- Tenure is negatively correlated with churn â€” new customers churn more.
- Electronic check payment method is common among churned customers.

## **Tools & Technologies**

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn (for optional modeling)

---

## ** Future Improvements**

- Feature engineering with interaction terms
- Customer segmentation using clustering
- Deploying a churn prediction dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI
